Prerequisites:
- JDK 1.6.x
- Eclipse 3.7.x
    - m2eclipse plug-in   (Maven integration)
    - subversive plug-in  (Subversion client)

Download from repository https://svn.code.sf.net/p/greenvulcanoesb/source/trunk the 'gvesb-parent' project.
Identify as GV_PROJECT_HOME the project path.

Common propaedeutic steps
- modify the (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/tools/maven/conf/user-settings.xml file content properly:
    - the 'localRepository' element must be populated with (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/maven-repository path
    - the 'greenv.project.home' element into the 'base-cfg' profile must be populated with (GV_PROJECT_HOME) path
  this file should be used for user-specific configurations and should NOT be uploaded to the SVN repository

Command line compilation
- open a shell
- change the PATH variable by entering at the beginning (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/tools/bin (Ant) and (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/tools/maven/bin (Maven2)
  or
  - modify the setenv.sh or setenv.bat setting the GV_PROJECT_HOME variable (the modified files should NOT be uploaded to the SVN repository)
  - lauch the appropriate OS script:
    - Unix: . setenv.sh
    - Windows: setenv.bat
- use the mvn command to start the compilation

Compilation by Eclipse GUI
- start Eclipse in a new workspace and install the specified plug-in
- configure the Maven plug-in:
    - from Installations tab add an external installation of Maven2: (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/tools/maven
    - form User Settings tab select the (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/tools/maven/conf/user-settings.xml file
- import the root project:
    - Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> root directory=(GV_PROJECT_HOME)
    - import all projects found
- if you are installing new Eclipse plug-ins, it is possible the .project file or the .settings directory to be changed: these changes are NOT to be uploaded to the SVN repository

In order to make the various installation packages refers to (GV_PROJECT_HOME)/build-release/readme.eng
