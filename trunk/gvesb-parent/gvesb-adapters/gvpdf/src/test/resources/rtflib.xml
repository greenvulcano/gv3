1 General Information
1.1 Introduction
The RTFLib package is an open-source, independent package suitable for writing RTF files in a java
environment. By independent we mean:
• Although it is used by FOP to generate FOP's RTF output, it is not dependent on FOP for any of its
functionality.
• It does not require FOP as a front-end, nor does it even require XSL-FO for input. It essentially
exposes an API of relatively high-level RTF construction routines to a host program. This means it
can be used anywhere RTF output is required and java is available.
The FOP development team intends to keep the RTFLib package independent so that it can be used for
other purposes.
1.2 History
RTFLib was originally developed by Bertrand Delacrétaz and the jfor team. jfor was written under an
Apache-style license, and the jfor team contributed the code to the Apache Software Foundation in June,
2003. RTFLib is a subset of the original jfor project, which also includes an XSL-FO parsing mechanism
for a complete XSL-FO to RTF solution.
1.3 Status
Although FOP's implementation of the RTFLib package is very incomplete, the RTFLib package itself is
relatively mature. RTFLib is only available in the trunk line of FOP development.
Warning:
This documentation is a work in progress. If you see errors or omissions, please report them to the fop-dev mailing
list.
2 User Documentation
2.1 Overview
Perhaps the easiest way to see how to use RTFLib is by looking at an example. A set of test documents is
part of the package, and can be viewed online. A quick look at the Abstract TestDocument class, and one
of the Concrete subclasses, SimpleDocument will provide the basics of how to use the package.
There are two basic concepts you will need to understand in order to use RTFLib:
• Documents are created by filling bigger containers with successively smaller containers, and
eventually with content.
• Attributes may be set for each container or content as it is created
RTFLib handles the process of converting to and writing the RTF content as the document is created. All
you need to do is flush the document at the end to make sure that the last pieces get written.

2.2 Document Structure
Warning:
This section is very incomplete.
The documentation in this section is intended to provide a high-level view of the process of building
an RTF document. For more detailed API documentation of the various methods, be sure to consult the
Javadocs for RTFLib.
The following table summarizes the various containers that can be created:

2.3 Attributes
Warning:
This section is very incomplete.
Attributes can be set for each container and piece of content in the document. The general approach is to
build an RtfAttributes object containing the various attributes, then pass that RtfAttributes object to the
method that creates the new container or content. See the Javadoc API documentation for RtfAttributes
for details on the syntax for creating an RtfAttributes object. The following information lists the various
attributes that can be set for each type of container.
