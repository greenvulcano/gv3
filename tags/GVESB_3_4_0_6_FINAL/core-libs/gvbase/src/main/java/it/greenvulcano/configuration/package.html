    This package implements the configuration mechanisms.
    <br>

    The XML configuration is contained in XML files searched in the class path.
    <p>
    The XML configuration is accessed using XPath strings and is based on
    Xalan/Jaxen implementation.
    <p>
    To access the configuration parameters it is available the
    <code>XMLConfig</code> class that exposes many static methods.
    <p>
    For example:
    <pre>
        // reads all nodes that match the given Xpath
        //
        NodeList nodeList = XMLConfig.getNodeList(XMLFILE, XPATH);

        // reads a node value
        //
        String value = XMLConfig.get(XMLFILE, XPATH);
    </pre>
    <p>
    To use the result you must import the <code>org.w3c.dom.*</code>
    package.
    <p>
    Note that the files are readed only the first time they are accessed.
    The files are not checked for changes.<br>
    To reload all files you must call the <code>XMLConfigu.reloadAll()</code>
    method (note that this method does not actually reload the configuration
    files, they will be reloaded when requested).
