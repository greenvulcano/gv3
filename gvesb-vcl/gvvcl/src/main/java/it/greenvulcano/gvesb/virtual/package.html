    This package implements mechanisms that implements the GreenVulcanoESB Virtual
    Communication Layer.<p>

    GreenVulcanoESB Virtual Communication Layer (GVVCL) layer separates GreenVulcano
    algorithms from other systems communication. Therefore it provides also support
    to multiple systems at same time.<p>

    <i>Definition</i> of GVVCL mechanisms is made by some interfaces and abstract
    classes.<p>

    <i>Implementation</i> of GVVCL mechanisms is made by classes that realize GVVCL
    interfaces and extends GVVCL abstract classes.<p>

    The implementation of GVVCL mechanisms allows GreenVulcanoESB to realize its
    algorithms on a concrete system.<br>
    It is possible that GreenVulcanoESB uses many implementations for many systems
    at same time.<p>
    
    Separation of definition from implementation of GVVCL mechanisms provides
    GreenVulcano system pluggability.<p>

    Core classes are <code>OperationFactory</code> and <code>OperationManager</code>
    that builds and caches objects that implements GVVCL mechanisms.<p>
